# Numerical Methods &amp; Optimization Algorithms

The purpose of this implementation was to understand numerical methods and optimization algorithms better through their implementation in Python. 

All of the UI/Server is handled in Shiny<b>(R)</b>. 

In order to use the application, you can clone this repo and then you can run the app through either of the .R files. If you have shiny installed, you should be able to see the button to run the shiny app.

<b>Here's the list of the methods/algorithms available in the app:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Finite Differences</li>
  <li>Trapezoidal Rule</li>
  <li>Incremental Search Method</li>
  <li>Bisection Method</li>
  <li>Newton-Raphson</li>
  <li>FONC SONC SOSC Evaluator</li>
  <li>Steepest Descent</li> 
</ul>

Feel free to use this, modify, or improve it in any way you like. There are still some particular constraints realted to how you input the function/values that can be improved.

Here's an example of how you can use the Steepest Descent algorithm. You just need to enter the function, the two initial points for the search, and a value for epsilon.

And as you can see you'll get the exact points at which the function is minimized near that interval and the value evaluated at the minimum.
