# Numerical Methods &amp; Optimization Algorithms

The idea of this shiny app was to understand numerical methods and optimization algorithms through their implementation. 

All of the UI/server is handled in shiny (R), and the back-end runs on a python script. 

In order to use the application, you can clone this repo and then you can run either of the .R files, and then if you have shiny installed, you should be able to see the button to run the shiny app. 

<b>Here's the list of the methods/algorithms available in the app:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Finite Differences</li>
  <li>Trapezoidal Rule</li>
  <li>Incremental Search Method</li>
  <li>Bisection Method</li>
  <li>Newton-Raphson</li>
  <li>FONC SONC SOSC evaluator</li>
  <li>Steepest Descent</li> 
</ul>

Feel free to use this and modify or improve them in any way you'd like. There are still some particular constraints in relation to how you input the functions/values that can be improved.
